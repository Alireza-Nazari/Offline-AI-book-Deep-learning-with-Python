[p127_e04] (body) For now, this is all you need to know about Keras models. At this point, you are ready to move on to solving real-world machine problems with Keras, in the next chapter.
[p127_e05] (heading_section) Summary
[p127_e06] (bullet) TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX are three popular low-level frameworks for numerical computation and autodifferentiation. They all have their own way of doing things and their own strengths and weaknesses.
[p127_e07] (bullet) Keras is a high-level API for building and training neural networks. It can be used with either TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX—just pick the backend you like best.
[p127_e08] (bullet) The central class of Keras is the `Layer`. A layer encapsulates some weights and some computation. Layers are assembled into models.
[p127_e09] (bullet) Before you start training a model, you need to pick an optimizer, a loss, and some metrics, which you specify via the `model.compile()` method.
[p127_e10] (bullet) To train a model, you can use the `fit()` method, which runs mini-batch gradient descent for you. You can also use it to monitor your loss and metrics on validation data, a set of inputs that the model doesn’t see during training.
[p127_e11] (bullet) Once your model is trained, you can use the `model.predict()` method to generate predictions on new inputs.

## Previous page (PDF 126) text, for continuity
data strictly separate: the purpose of validation is to monitor whether what the model is learning is actually useful on new data. If any of the validation data has been seen by the model during training, your validation loss and metrics will be flawed.

If you want to compute the validation loss and metrics after training is complete, you can call the `evaluate` method:

`evaluate()` will iterate in batches (of size `batch_size`) over the data passed and return a list of scalars, where the first entry is the validation loss and the following entries are the validation metrics. If the model has no metrics, only the validation loss is returned (rather than a list).

3.6.8

Inference: Using a model after training

Once you’ve trained your model, you’re going to want to use it to make predictions on new data. This is called inference. To do this, a naive approach would simply be to `__call__()` the model:

However, this will process all inputs in `new_inputs` at once, which may not be feasible if you’re looking at a lot of data (in particular, it may require more memory than your GPU has).

A better way to do inference is to use the `predict()` method. It will iterate over the data in small batches and return a NumPy array of predictions. And unlike `__call__()`, it can also process TensorFlow `Dataset` objects:

For instance, if we use `predict()` on some of our validation data with the linear model we trained earlier, we get scalar scores that correspond to the model’s prediction for each input sample:

problems

Handling continuous regression problems

This chapter is designed to get you started with using neural networks to solve real problems. You’ll consolidate the knowledge you gained from chapters 2 and 3, and you’ll apply what you’ve learned to three new tasks covering the three most common use cases of neural networks—binary classification, categorical classification, and scalar regression:

Classifying movie reviews as positive or negative (binary classification)

Classifying news wires by topic (categorical classification)

Estimating the price of a house, given real estate data (scalar regression)

These examples will be your first contact with end-to-end machine learning workflows: you’ll get introduced to data preprocessing, basic model architecture principles, and model evaluation.

### PDF p.87 (printed 63) — 3 Introduction to TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and Keras › 3.3 Introduction to TensorFlow › How these frameworks relate to each other
Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX don’t all have the same feature set and aren’t interchangeable. They have some overlap, but to a large extent, they serve different roles for different use cases. The biggest difference is between Keras and the three others. Keras is a high-level framework, while the others are lower level. Imagine building a house. Keras is like a prefabricated building kit: it provides a streamlined interface for setting up and training neural networks. In contrast, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX are like the raw materials used in construction.

As you saw in the previous chapters, training a neural network revolves around the following concepts:

First, low-level tensor manipulation—The infrastructure that underlies all modern machine learning. This translates to low-level APIs found in TensorFlow, PyTorch,2 and JAX: – Tensors, including special tensors that store the network’s state (variables) – Tensor operations such as addition, `relu`, or `matmul` – Backpropagation, a way to compute the gradient of mathematical expressions

Second, high-level deep learning concepts—This translates to Keras APIs: – Layers, which are combined into a model – A loss function, w

### PDF p.239 (printed 215) — 7 A deep dive on Keras › 7.4 Writing your own training and evaluation loops › Training vs. inference
In the low-level training loop examples you’ve seen so far, step 1 (the forward pass) was done via `predictions = model(inputs)`, and step 2 (retrieving the gradients computed by the gradient tape) was done via a backend-specific API, such as

`gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.weights)` in TensorFlow

`loss.backward()` in PyTorch

`jax.value_and_grad()` in JAX

In the general case, there are actually two subtleties you need to take into account.

Some Keras layers, such as the `Dropout` layer, have different behaviors during training and during inference (when you use them to generate predictions). Such layers expose a `training` Boolean argument in their `call()` method. Calling `dropout(inputs, ` `training=True)` will drop some activation entries, while calling `dropout(inputs, ` `training=False)` does nothing. By extension, Functional models and Sequential models also expose this `training` argument in their `call()` methods. Remember to pass `training=True` when you call a Keras model during the forward pass! Our forward pass thus becomes `predictions = model(inputs, training=True)`. In addition, note that when you retrieve the gradients of the weights of your model, you s

frameworks and their relationships

An overview of how core deep learning concepts

translate to code across all frameworks

This chapter is meant to give you everything you need to start doing deep learning in practice. First, you’ll get familiar with three popular deep learning frameworks that can be used with Keras:

TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org)

PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/)

JAX (https://jax.readthedocs.io/)

Then, building on top of the first contact you’ve had with Keras in chapter 2, we’ll review the core components of neural networks and how they translate to Keras APIs.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll be ready to move on to practical, real-world applications—which will start with chapter 4.

### PDF p.254 (printed 230) — 7 A deep dive on Keras › 7.4 Writing your own training and evaluation loops › Summary
Keras offers a spectrum of different workflows, based on the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity. They all smoothly interoperate.

You can build models via the `Sequential` class, via the Functional API, or by subclassing the `Model` class. Most of the time, you’ll be using the Functional API.

The simplest way to train and evaluate a model is via the default `fit()` and `evaluate()` methods.

Keras callbacks provide a simple way to monitor models during your call to `fit()` and automatically take action based on the state of the model.

You can also fully control what `fit()` does by overriding the `train_step()` method, using APIs from your backend of choice—JAX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Beyond `fit()`, you can also write your own training loops entirely from scratch, in a backend-native way. This is useful for researchers implementing brand-new training algorithms.

### PDF p.115 (printed 91) — 3 Introduction to TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and Keras › 3.6 Introduction to Keras › Picking a backend framework
Keras can be used together with JAX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. They’re the “backend frameworks” of Keras. Through these backend frameworks, Keras can run on top of different types of hardware (see figure 3.4)—GPU, TPU, or plain CPU—can be seamlessly scaled to thousands of machines, and can be deployed to a variety of platforms.

Backend frameworks are pluggable: you can switch to a different backend framework after you’ve written some Keras code. You aren’t locked into a single framework and a single ecosystem—you can move your models from JAX to TensorFlow to PyTorch depending on your current needs. For instance, when you develop a Keras model, you could debug it with PyTorch, train it on TPU with JAX for maximum efficiency, and finally run inference with the excellent tooling from the TensorFlow ecosystem.

Figure 3.4 Keras and its backends. A backend is a low-level tensor-computing platform; Keras is a high-level deep learning API.

The default backend for Keras right now is TensorFlow, so if you run `import` `keras` in a fresh environment, without having configured anything, you will be running on top of TensorFlow. There are two ways to pick a different backend:

Set the environ

The PyTorch API is higher level than that of TensorFlow and JAX: it includes layers and optimizers, like Keras. These layers and optimizers are compatible with Keras workflows when you use Keras with the PyTorch backend.

Waymo self-driving cars rely on Keras models for processing sensor data. Keras is also a popular framework on Kaggle, the machine learning competition website.

Because Keras has a diverse user base, it doesn’t force you to follow a single “true” way of building and training models. Rather, it enables a wide range of different workflows, from the very high-level to the very low-level, corresponding to different user profiles. For instance, you have an array of ways to build models and an array of ways to train them, each representing a certain tradeoff between usability and flexibility. In chapter 7, we’ll review in detail a good fraction of this spectrum of workflows.

NOTE When configuring the Keras backend, you should use the string `"torch"` to refer to the PyTorch backend, rather than the string `"pytorch"`, which would be invalid. This is because the PyTorch package name is `torch` (as in `import ` `torch` or `pip` `install` `torch`). Now, you may ask, which backend should I be picking? It’s really your own choice: all Keras code examples in the rest of the book will be compatible with all three backends. If the need for backend-specific code arises (as in chapter 7, for instance), we will show you all three versions—TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX. If you have no particular backend preference, our personal recommendation is JAX. It’s usually the most performant backend. Once your backend is configured, you can start actually building and training Keras models. Let’s take a look.
