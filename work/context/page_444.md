[p444_e03] (bullet) An embedding is an efficient way to transform token IDs into a learned latent space. Embeddings can be trained normally with gradient descent.
[p444_e04] (bullet) Pretraining is critical for sequence models as a way to get around the data-hungry nature of these models. During pretraining, an unsupervised task allows models to learn from large amounts of unlabeled text data. The learned parameters can then be transferred to a downstream task.

## Previous page (PDF 443) text, for continuity
With the pretrained embedding weights, we have boosted our LSTM performance to roughly the same as our set-based models. We do slightly better than the unigram model and slightly worse than the bigram model.

This may seem like a bit of a letdown after all the work we put in. Is learning on the entire sequence, with order information, just a bad idea? The problem is that we are still data-constrained for our final LSTM model. The model is expressive and powerful enough that with enough movie reviews, we would easily outperform set-based approaches, but we need a lot more training on ordered data before our model’s performance ceiling is reached. This is an easily solvable problem with enough compute resources. In the next chapter, we will cover the transformer model. The model is slightly better at learning dependencies across longer token sequences, but most critically, these models are often trained on large amounts of English text, including all word order information. This allows the model to learn, roughly speaking, a statistical form of the grammatical patterns that govern language. These types of statistical patterns around word order are precisely why our current LSTM model is too data-constrained to learn effectively. However, as we move on to large, more advanced models that will push the limits of text-classification performance, it is worth pointing out that simple set-based regression approaches like our bigram model give you a lot of “bang for your buck.” Set-based models are lightning-fast and can contain just a few thousand parameters, a far cry from the billion-parameter large language models that dominate the news today. If you are working in an environment where compute is limited and you can sacrifice some accuracy, set-based models can often be the  …

With the basics of text preprocessing and modeling covered in the previous chapter, this chapter will tackle some more involved language problems such as machine translation. We will build up a solid intuition for the Transformer model that powers products like ChatGPT and has helped trigger a wave of investment in natural language processing (NLP).

15.1 The language model

In the previous chapter, we learned how to convert text data to numeric inputs, and we used this numeric representation to classify movie reviews. However, text classification is, in many ways, a uniquely simple problem. We only need to output a single floating-point number for binary classification and, at worst, N numbers for N-way classification.

The last decade of rapid advancement in NLP has coincided with the rise of pretraining as the dominant approach for text modeling problems. Once we move past simple set-based regression models to sequence models with millions or even billions of parameters, text models become incredibly data-hungry. We are usually limited by our ability to find labeled examples for a particular problem in the text domain.

The idea is to devise an unsupervised task to train model parameters that do not need labeled data. Pretraining data can be text in a similar domain to our final task, or even just arbitrary text in the languages we are interested in working with. Pretraining allows us to learn general patterns in language, effectively priming our model before we specialize it to the final task we are interested in. Word embeddings were one of the first big successes with text pretraining, and we will show how to pretrain a word embedding in this section. Remember the `unsup/` directory we ignored in our IMDb dataset preparation? It contains another 25,000 reviews— the same size as our training data. We will combine all our training data together and show how to pretrain the parameters of an `Emb

With the embedding, we have reduced both our training time and model size by an order of magnitude. A learned embedding is clearly far more efficient than one-hot encoding our input.

However, the LSTM’s overall performance did not change. Accuracy was stubbornly around 84%, still a far cry from the bag-of-words and bigram models. Does this mean that a “structured embedding space” for input tokens is not that practically useful? Or is it not useful for text classification tasks? Quite the contrary, a well-trained token embedding space can dramatically improve the practical performance ceiling of a model like this. The issue in this particular case is with our training setup. We lack enough data in our 20,000 review examples to effectively train a good word embedding. By the end of our 10 training epochs, our train set accuracy has cracked 99%. Our model has begun to overfit and memorize our input, and it turns out it is doing so well before we have learned an optimal set of word embeddings for the task at hand. For cases like this, we can turn to pretraining. Rather than training our word embedding jointly with the classification task, we can train it separately, on more data, with

Now that we have trained a new word embedding, applying it to our LSTM model is simple. First, we create the model precisely as we did before.

model were released a year after “Attention Is All You Need.” The model structure was exactly the same as the encoder part of the translation Transformer we just built. This encoder model is bidirectional in that every position in the sequence can attend to positions in front of and behind it. This means it’s a good model for computing a rich representation of input text, but not a model meant to run generation in a loop.

BERT was trained in sizes between 100 million and 300 million parameters, much bigger than the 14 million parameter Transformer we just trained. This meant the model needed a lot of training data to perform well. To achieve this, the authors used a riff on the classic language modeling setup called masked language modeling. To pretrain the model, we take a sequence of text and replace about 15% of the tokens with a special `[MASK]` token. The model will attempt to predict the original masked token values during training. While the classic language model, sometimes called a causal language model, attempts to predict `p(token|past` `tokens)`, the masked language model attempts to predict `p(token|surrounding` `tokens)`. This training setup is unsupervised. You don’

Figure 14.5 An `Embedding` layer acts as a dictionary mapping ints to floating point vectors.

When you instantiate an `Embedding` layer, its weights (its internal dictionary of token vectors) are initially random, just as with any other layer. During training, these word vectors are gradually adjusted via backpropagation, structuring the space into something the downstream model can exploit. Once fully trained, the embedding space will show a lot of structure—a kind of structure specialized for the specific problem for which you’re training your model.

Let’s build a model with an `Embedding` layer and benchmark it on our task.

After preprocessing, we can see that we have eight integer token IDs as context paired with a single token ID label.

The model we train with this data is exceedingly simple. We will use an `Embedding` layer to embed all context tokens and a `GlobalAveragePooling1D` to compute the average embedding of our “bag” of context tokens. Then, we use that average embedding to predict the value of our middle label token. That’s it! By repeatedly refining our embedding space so that we are good at predicting a word based on nearby word embeddings, we learn a rich embedding of tokens used in movie reviews.
