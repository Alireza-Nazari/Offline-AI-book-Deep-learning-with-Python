[p457_e03] (body) into another is to keep the output of the RNN at each time step and predict an output token from it. In Keras, it would look like this:
[p457_e04] (code)
```
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(sequence_length,), dtype="int32")
x = layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=128)(inputs)
x = layers.LSTM(32, return_sequences=True)(x)
outputs = layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation="softmax")(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
```
[p457_e05] (body) However, there is a critical issue with this approach. Due to the step-by-step nature of RNNs, the model will only look at tokens `0...N` in the source sequence to predict token `N` in the target sequence. Consider translating the sentence, “I will bring the bag to you.” In Spanish, that would be “Te traeré la bolsa,” where “Te,” the first word of the translation, corresponds to “you” in the English source text. There’s simply no way to output the first word of the translation without seeing the last word of the source English text!
[p457_e06] (body) If you’re a human translator, you’d start by reading the entire source sentence before beginning to translate it. This is especially important if you’re dealing with languages with wildly different word ordering. And that’s precisely what standard sequence-to-sequence models do. In a proper sequence-to-sequence setup (see figure 15.2), you would first use an encoder RNN to turn the entire source sequence into a single representation of the source text. This could be the last output of the RNN or, alternatively, its final internal state vectors. We can use this representation as the initial state of a decoder RNN in the language model setup instead of an initial state of zeros, which we used in our Shakespeare generator. This decoder learns to predict the next word of the Spanish translation given the current word of the translation, with all information about the English sequence coming from that initial RNN state.

[p457_e08] (body) Let’s implement this in Keras, with GRU-based encoders and decoders. We can start with just the encoder. Since we will not actually be predicting tokens in the encoder sequence, we don’t have to worry about “cheating” by letting the model pass information from the end of the sequence to positions at the beginning. In fact, this is a good

be used to tell Keras which labels to use when calculating our loss and metrics. Our output translations are not all equal in length, and some of our label sequences will be padded with zeros. We only care about predictions for non-zero labels that represent actual translated text.

This matches the “off by one” label set up in the generation model we just built, with the addition of the fixed encoder inputs, which will be handled separately in our model.

Here’s what our dataset outputs look like:

The data is now ready—time to build some models.

15.2.2 Sequence-to-sequence learning with RNNs

Before we try the twin encoder/decoder setup we previously mentioned, let’s think through simpler options. The easiest, naive way to use RNNs to turn one sequence

idea, as we want a rich representation of the source sequence. We can achieve this with a `Bidirectional` layer.

Listing 15.11 Building a sequence-to-sequence encoder

Next, let’s add the decoder—a simple `GRU` layer that takes as its initial state the encoded source sentence. On top of it, we add a `Dense` layer that produces a probability distribution over the Spanish vocabulary for each output step. Here, we want to predict the next tokens based only on what came before, so a `Bidirectional` RNN would break training by making the loss function trivially easy.

Let’s take a look at the seq2seq model in full:

Note that this inference setup, while very simple, is inefficient, since we reprocess the entire source sentence and the entire generated target sentence every time we sample a new word. In a practical application, you’d want to be careful not to recompute any state that has not changed. All we really need to predict a new token in the decoder is the current token and the previous RNN state, which we could cache before each loop iteration. There are many ways this toy model could be improved. We could use a deep stack of recurrent layers for both the encoder and the decoder, we could try other RNN layers like `LSTM`, and so on. Beyond such tweaks, however, the RNN approach to sequence-to-sequence learning has a few fundamental limitations:

The source sequence representation has to be held entirely in the encoder state vector, which significantly limits the size and complexity of the sentences you can translate.

RNNs have trouble dealing with very long sequences since they tend to progressively forget about the past—by the time you’ve reached the 100th token in either sequence, little information remains about the start of the sequence.

Recurrent neural networks dominated sequenc

The general template behind sequence-to-sequence models is described in figure 15.1. During training the following happen:

An encoder model turns the source sequence into an intermediate representation.

A decoder is trained using the language modeling setup we saw previously. It will recursively predict the next token in the target sequence by looking at all previous target tokens and our encoder’s representation of the source sequence.

During inference, we don’t have access to the target sequence—we’re trying to predict it from scratch. We will generate it one token at a time, just as we did with our Shakespeare generator:

We obtain the encoded source sequence from the encoder.

The decoder starts by looking at the encoded source sequence as well as an initial “seed” token (such as the string `"[start]"`) and uses them to predict the first real token in the sequence.

The predicted sequence so far is fed back into the decoder, in a loop, until it generates a stop token (such as the string `"[end]"`).

Figure 15.1 Sequence-to-sequence learning: the source sequence is processed by the encoder and is then sent to the decoder. The decoder looks at the target sequence so far and pr

After training, we get to about 58% accuracy: on average, the model correctly predicts the next word in the Spanish sentence 58% of the time. Something is off here. Training is worse than the RNN model by 7 percentage points. Either this Transformer architecture is not what it was hyped up to be, or we missed something in our implementation. Can you spot what it is?

This section is ostensibly about sequence models. In the previous chapter, we saw how vital word order could be to meaning. And yet, the Transformer we just built wasn’t a sequence model at all. Did you notice? It’s composed of dense layers that process sequence tokens independently of each other and an attention layer that looks at the tokens as a set. You could change the order of the tokens in a sequence, and you’d get identical pairwise attention scores and the same context-aware representations. If you were to rearrange every word in every English source sentence completely, the model wouldn’t notice, and you’d still get the same accuracy. Attention is a set-processing mechanism, focused on the relationships between pairs of sequence elements—it’s blind to whether these elements occur at the beginning, at the end,

### PDF p.488 (printed 464) — 15 Language models and the Transformer › 15.5 What makes the Transformer effective? › Summary
A language model is a model that learns a specific probability distribution— `p(token|past tokens)`: – Language models have broad applications, but the most important is that you can generate text by calling them in a loop, where the output token at one time step becomes the input token in the next. – A masked language model learns a related probability distribution `p(tokens|surrounding` `tokens)` and can be helpful for classifying text and individual tokens. – A sequence-to-sequence language model learns to predict the next token given both past tokens in a target sequence and an entirely separate, fixed source sequence. Sequence-to-sequence models are useful for problems like translation and question answering. – A sequence-to-sequence model usually has two separate components. An encoder computes a representation of the source sequence, and a decoder takes this representation as input and predicts the next token in a target sequence based on past tokens.

Attention is a mechanism that allows a model to pull information from anywhere in a sequence selectively based on the context of the token currently being processed: – Attention avoids the problems RNNs have with long-range de

Now we are ready to let the model predict a new output sequence. In a loop, up to a desired length, we will continually select the most likely next character predicted by the model, feed that to the model, and persist the new RNN state. In this way, we can predict an entire sequence, a token at time.

What about other text-based tasks like question answering or translation? For many real-world problems, we are interested in a model that can generate a text output for a given input. Just like we needed tokenizers and embeddings to help us handle text on the way in to a model, we must build up some techniques before we can produce text on the way out. We don’t need to start from scratch here; we can continue to use the idea of an integer sequence as a natural numeric representation for text. In the previous chapter, we covered tokenizing a string, where we split inputs into tokens and map each token to an int. We can detokenize a sequence by proceeding in reverse—map ints back to string tokens and join them together. With this approach, our problem becomes building a model that can predict an integer sequence of tokens. The simplest option to consider might be to train a direct classifier over the space of all possible output integer sequences, but some back-of-the-envelope math will quickly show this is intractable. With a vocabulary of 20,000 words, there are 20,000 ^ 4, or 160 quadrillion possible 4-word sequences, and fewer atoms in the universe than possible 20-word sequences

Our last two models indicated that sequence information is important. We improved a basic linear model by adding features with some info on local word order.

However, this was done by manually engineering input features, and we can see how the approach will only scale up to a local ordering of just a few words. As is often the case in deep learning, rather than attempting to build these features ourselves, we should expose the model to the raw word sequence and let it directly learn positional dependencies between tokens. Models that ingest a complete token sequence are called, simply enough, sequence models. We have a few choices for architecture here. We could build an RNN model as we just did for timeseries modeling. We could build a 1D ConvNet, similar to our image processing models, but convolving filters over a single sequence dimension. And as we will dig into in the next chapter, we can build a Transformer. Before taking on any of these approaches, we must preprocess our inputs into ordered sequences. We want an integer sequence of token IDs, as we saw in the tokenization portion of this chapter, but with one additional wrinkle to handle. When we run computations on a batc

Let’s take the language model idea and extend it to tackle an important problem— machine translation. Translation belongs to a class of modeling problems often called sequence-to-sequence modeling (or seq2seq if you are trying to save keystrokes). We seek to build a model that can take in a source text as a fixed input sequence and generate the translated text sequence as a result. Question answering is another classic sequence-to-sequence problem.
