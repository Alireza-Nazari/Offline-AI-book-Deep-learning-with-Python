[p512_e03] (body) Of course, this is utter nonsense, but the model could not find a more likely way to complete this prompt.
[p512_e04] (body) Hallucinations and uncontrollable output are fundamental problems with language models. If there is a silver bullet, we have yet to find it. However, one approach that helps immensely is to further fine-tune a model with examples of the specific types of generative outputs you would like. In the specific case of wanting to build a chatbot that can follow instructions, this type of training is called instruction fine-tuning. Let’s try some instruction fine-tuning with Gemma to make it a lot more useful as a conversation partner.
[p512_e05] (heading_subsection) 16.3.2 Instruction fine-tuning
[p512_e06] (body) Instruction fine-tuning involves feeding the model input/output pairs—a user instruction followed by a model response. We combine these into a single sequence that becomes new training data for the model. To make it clear during training when an instruction or response ends, we can add special markers like `"[instruction]"` and `"[response]"` directly to the combined sequence. The precise markup will not matter much as long as it is consistent.
[p512_e07] (body) We can use the combined sequence as regular training data, with the same “guess the next word” loss we used to pretrain an LLM. By doing further training with examples containing desired responses, we are essentially bending the model’s output in the direction we want. We won’t be learning a latent space for language here; that’s already been done over trillions of tokens of pretraining. We are simply nudging the learned representation a bit to control the tone and content of the output. To begin, we will need a dataset of instruction-response pairs. Training chatbots is a hot topic, so there are many datasets made specifically for this purpose. We will use a dataset made public by the company Databricks. Employees contributed to a dataset of 15,000 instructions and handwritten responses. Let’s download it and join the data into a single sequence.

## Previous page (PDF 511) text, for continuity
As we saw with the mini-GPT example, this is not so much a bug as a consequence of our pretraining objective. The Gemma model was trained with the same “guess the next word” objective we used for mini-GPT, which means it’s effectively a fancy autocomplete for the internet. It will just keep rattling off the most probable word in its single sequence as if your prompt was a snippet of text found in a random document on the web. One way to change our output is to prompt the model with a longer input that makes it obvious which type of output we are looking for. For example, if we prompt the Gemma model with the beginning two sentences of a brownie recipe, we get more helpful output:

Though it’s tempting when working with a model that can “talk” to imagine it interpreting our prompt in some sort of human, conversational way, nothing of the sort is going on here. We have just constructed a prompt for which an actual brownie recipe is a more likely continuation than mimicking someone posting on a forum asking for baking help.

You can go much further in constructing prompts. You might prompt a model with some natural language instructions of the role it is supposed to fill, for example, `"You` `are a large language model that gives short, helpful answers to people's questions."` Or you might feed the model a prompt containing a long list of harmful topics that should not be included in any generated responses. If this all sounds a bit hand-wavy and hard to control, that’s a good assessment. Attempting to visit different parts of a model’s distribution through prompting is often useful, but predicting how a model will respond to a given prompt is very difficult. Another well-documented problem faced by LLMs is hallucinations. A model will always say something—there is always  …

Note that some examples have additional context—textual information related to the instruction. To keep things simple for now, we will discard those examples.

Let’s take a look at a single element in our dataset:

Our prompt template gives our examples a predictable structure. Although Gemma is not a sequence-to-sequence model like our English-to-Spanish translator, we can still use it in a sequence-to-sequence setting by training on prompts like this and only generating the output after the `"[response]"` marker.

Let’s make a `tf.data.Dataset` and split some validation data:

The `CausalLM` we loaded from the KerasHub library is a high-level object for end-to-end causal language modeling. It wraps two objects: a `preprocessor` layer, which preprocesses text input, and a `backbone` model, which contains the numerics of the model forward pass.

Preprocessing is included by default in high-level Keras functions like `fit()` and `predict()`. But let’s run our preprocessing on a single batch so we can better see what it is doing:

LLM output is unreliable, and all LLMs will occasionally hallucinate factually incorrect information.

LLMs can be fine-tuned to follow instructions in a chat dialog. This type of

fine-tuning is called instruction fine-tuning:

– The simplest form of instruction fine-tuning involves directly training the

model on instruction and response pairs. – More advanced forms of instruction fine-tuning involve reinforcement learning.

The most common resource bottleneck when working with LLMs is accelerator memory.

LoRA is a technique to reduce memory usage by freezing most Transformer parameters and only updating a low-rank decomposition of attention projection weights.

LLMs can input or output data from different modalities if you can figure out how to frame these inputs or outputs as sequences in a sequence prediction problem.

A foundation model is a general term for models of any modality trained using self-supervision for a wide range of downstream tasks.

Not at all. However, we could still use instruction tuning to make some inroads here. A common technique is to train the model on a lot of instruction/response pairs where the desired response is `"I` `don't` `know"` or `"As` `a` `language` `model,` `I` `cannot` `help` `you` `with ` `that"`. This can train the model to avoid attempting to answer specific topics where it would often give poor-quality results.

### PDF p.528 (printed 504) — 16 Text generation › 16.5 Where are LLMs heading next? › 
In the first attempt, our model was hung up on the superfluous detail that each letter has two pages. In the second attempt, the model gets the problem right. This instruction-tuned Gemma model we are working with has already been tuned on math problems like this; you would not get nearly as good results from the “untuned” Gemma model from the last section.

We could extend this idea to a very simple form of chain-of-thought training: 1 Collect a bunch of basic math and reasoning problems and desired answers. 2 Generate (with some randomness) a number of responses. 3 Find all the responses with a correct answer via string parsing. You can prompt

the model to use a specific text marker for the final answer as we did previously. 4 Run supervised fine-tuning on correct responses, including all the intermediate output. 5 Repeat! The previously described process is a reinforcement learning algorithm. Our answer checking acts as the environment, and the generated outputs are the actions the model uses to learn. As with RLHF, in practice you would use a more complex gradient update step to use information from all responses (even the incorrect ones), but the basic principle is the same. 

### PDF p.519 (printed 495) — 16 Text generation › 16.4 Going further with LLMs › 16.4.1 Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
Any need to manually write text examples will almost always become a bottleneck— such data is slow and expensive to come by. Moreover, this approach will be limited by the human performance ceiling on the instruction-following task. If we want to do better than human performance in a chatbot-like experience, we cannot rely on manually written output to supervise LLM training. The real problem we are trying to optimize is our preference for certain responses over others. With a large enough sample of people, this preference problem is perfectly defined, but figuring out how to translate from “our preferences” to a loss function we could use to compute gradients is quite tricky. This is what Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, or RLHF, attempts to solve. The first step in RLHF fine-tuning is exactly what we did in the last section—supervised fine-tuning with handwritten prompts and responses. This gets us to a good baseline performance; we now need to improve on this baseline. To this end, we will build a reward model that can act as a proxy for human preference. We can gather a large number of prompts and responses to these prompts. Some of these responses can be handwritten

We can make this more concrete by trying a model trained with this form of iterative preference tuning. Since building chatbots is the “killer app” for large Transformer models, it is common practice for companies that release pretrained models like Gemma to release specialized “instruction-tuned” versions, built just for chat. Let’s try loading one now. This will be a 4-billion-parameter model, quadruple the size of the model we just loaded and the largest model we will use in this book.

### PDF p.521 (printed 497) — 16 Text generation › 16.4 Going further with LLMs › Choosing a dtype for large models
This 4-billion-parameter model was first pretrained on 14 trillion tokens of text and then extensively fine-tuned to make it more helpful when answering questions. Some of this tuning was done with supervised fine-tuning like we did in the previous section, some with RLHF as we covered in this section, and some with still other techniques— like using an even larger model as a “teacher” to guide training. The increase in ability to do question-answering is easily noticeable.

Let’s try this model on the prompt that has been giving us trouble with hallucinations:

Each of our input prompts contains the special token `<start_of_image>`. This is turned into 256 placeholder values in our input sequence, which, in turn, is replaced with the soft tokens representing our image.

Training for a multimodal model like this is quite similar to regular LLM pretraining and fine-tuning. Usually, you would want to first pretrain your image encoder separately, like we first did in Chapter 8 of this book. Then you can simply do the same basic “guess the next word” pretraining and also feed in mixed image and text content combined into a single sequence. Our transformer would not be trained to output image soft tokens; we would simply zero the loss at these image token locations. It might seem almost magical that we can simply add image data to an LLM, but when we consider the power of the sequence model we’re working with, it’s really quite an expected result. We’ve taken a Transformer, recast our image input as sequence data, and done a lot of extra training. The model can preserve the original language model’s ability to ingest and produce text while learning to also embed images in the Transformer’s latent space.
