[p561_e03] (body) This might feel like magic the first time you try it, but there’s nothing magic about it— interpolation is fundamental to the way deep neural networks learn. This will be the last substantive model we work with in the book, and it’s a great visual metaphor to end with. Deep neural networks are interpolation machines; they map complex, real-world probability distributions to low-dimensional manifolds. We can exploit this fact even for input as complex as human language and output as complex as natural images.
[p561_e04] (heading_section) Summary
[p561_e05] (bullet) Image generation with deep learning is done by learning latent spaces that capture statistical information about a dataset of images. By sampling and decoding points from the latent space, you can generate never-before-seen images. There are three major tools to do this: VAEs, diffusion models, and GANs.
[p561_e06] (bullet) VAEs result in highly structured, continuous latent representations. For this reason, they work well for doing all sorts of image editing in latent space: face swapping, turning a frowning face into a smiling face, and so on. They also work nicely for doing latent space–based animations, such as animating a walk along a cross section of the latent space, showing a starting image slowly morphing into different images in a continuous way.
[p561_e07] (bullet) Diffusion models result in very realistic outputs and are the dominant method of image generation today. They work by repeatedly denoising an image, starting from pure noise. They can easily be conditioned on text captions to create text-to-image models.
[p561_e08] (bullet) Stable Diffusion 3 is a state-of-the-art pretrained text-to-image model that you can use to create highly realistic images of your own.
[p561_e09] (bullet) The visual latent space learned by such text-to-image diffusion models is fundamentally interpolative. You can see this by interpolating between the text embeddings used as inputs to the diffusion process and achieving a smooth interpolation between images as output.

between these two points would land us inside the sphere. We would no longer be on its surface. We would like to stay on the surface of the smooth manifold learned by our text embedding— that’s where embedding points have meaning for our denoising model. See figure 17.16.

Of course, the manifold learned by our text embedding model is not actually spherical. But it’s a smooth surface of numbers all with the same rough magnitude—it is sphere-like, and interpolating as if we were on a sphere is a better approximation than interpolat

close to the surface of our manifold.

With our interpolation defined, let’s try walking between the text embeddings for two prompts and generating an image at each interpolated output. We will run our `slerp` function from 0.5 to 0.6 (out of 0 to 1) to zoom in on the middle of the interpolation right when the “morph” becomes visually obvious (figure 17.17):

You’ve come quite far since the beginning of this book. You can now train image classification models, image segmentation models, models for classification or regression on vector data, timeseries forecasting models, text classification models, sequence-to-sequence models, and even generative models for text and images. You’ve got all the bases covered.

However, your models so far have all been trained at a small scale—on small datasets, with a single GPU—and they generally haven’t reached the best achievable performance on each dataset we’ve looked at. This book is, after all, an introductory book. If you are to go out into the real world and achieve state-of-the-art results on brand new problems, there’s still a bit of a chasm that you’ll need to cross.

There is probably no better way to see the interpolative nature of deep neural networks than text diffusion models. The text encoder used by our model will learn a smooth, low-dimensional manifold to represent our input prompts. It’s continuous, meaning we have learned a space where we can walk from the text representation of one prompt to another, and each intermediate point will have semantic meaning. We can couple that with our diffusion process to morph between two images by simply describing each end state with a text prompt.

The key idea of image generation is to develop a low-dimensional latent space of representations (which, like everything else in deep learning, is a vector space) where any point can be mapped to a “valid” image: an image that looks like the real thing. The module capable of realizing this mapping, taking as input a latent point and outputting an image (a grid of pixels), is usually called a generator, or sometimes a decoder. Once such a latent space has been learned, you can sample points from it, and, by mapping them back to image space, generate images that have never been seen before (see figure 17.1)—the in-betweens of the training images.

Further, text-conditioning makes it possible to map a space of prompts in natural language to the latent space (see figure 17.2), making it possible to do language-guided image generation—generating pictures that correspond to a text description. This category of models is called text-to-image models.

Interpolating between many training images in the latent space enables such models to generate infinite combinations of visual concepts, including many that no one had explicitly c

We can use the same basic diffusion process to create a model that maps text input to image output. To do this we need to take a pretrained text encoder (think a transformer encoder like RoBERTa from chapter 15) that can map text to vectors in a continuous embedding space. Then we can train a diffusion model on `(prompt,` `image)` pairs, where each prompt is a short, textual description of the input image.

We can handle the image input in the same way as we did previously, mapping noisy input to a denoised output that progressively approaches our input image. Critically, we can extend this setup by also passing the embedded text prompt to the denoising model. So rather than our denoising model simply taking in a `noisy_images` input, our model will take two inputs: `noisy_images` and `text_embeddings`. This gives a leg up on the flower denoiser we trained previously. Instead of learning to remove noise from an image without any additional information, the model gets to use a textual representation of the final image to help guide the denoising process. After training is when things get a bit more fun. Because we have trained a model that can map pure noise to images conditioned on

Of course, there are still challenges to overcome. Like with all deep learning models, the latent space doesn’t encode a consistent model of the physical world, so you might occasionally see hands with extra fingers, incoherent lighting, or garbled objects. The coherence of generated images is still an area of active research. In the case of figure 17.2, despite having seen tens of thousands of images of people riding bikes, the model doesn’t understand in a human sense what it means to ride a bike—concepts like pedaling, steering, or maintaining upright balance. That’s why your bike-riding horse is unlikely to get depicted pedaling with its hind legs in a believable manner, the way a human artist would draw it.

There’s a range of different strategies for learning such latent spaces of image representations, each with its own characteristics. The most common types of image generation models are

Diffusion models

Variational autoencoders (VAEs)

Generative adversarial networks (GANs)

While previous editions of this book covered GANs, they have gradually fallen out of fashion in recent years and have been all but replaced by diffusion models. In this edition, we’ll cover both VAEs

the original image, via a decoder module (see figure 17.3). It’s then trained by using as target data the same images as the input images, meaning the autoencoder learns to reconstruct the original inputs. By imposing various constraints on the code (the output of the encoder), you can get the autoencoder to learn more or less interesting latent representations of the data. Most commonly, you’ll constrain the code to be low dimensional and sparse (mostly zeros), in which case the encoder acts as a way to compress the input data into fewer bits of information.

Figure 17.3 An autoencoder: mapping an input `x` to a compressed representation and then decoding it back as `x'`

In practice, such classical autoencoders don’t lead to particularly useful or nicely structured latent spaces. They’re not much good at compression either. For these reasons, they have largely fallen out of fashion. VAEs, however, augment autoencoders with a little bit of statistical magic that forces them to learn continuous, highly structured latent spaces. They have turned out to be a powerful tool for image generation.

A VAE, instead of compressing its input image into a fixed code in the latent space, turns
