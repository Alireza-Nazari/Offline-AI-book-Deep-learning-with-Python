[p173_e04] (heading_section) Evaluating machine-learning models
[p173_e05] (body) You can only control what you can observe. Since your goal is to develop models that can successfully generalize to new data, it’s essential to be able to reliably measure the generalization power of your model. In this section, we’ll formally introduce the different ways you can evaluate machine learning models. You’ve already seen most of them in action in the previous chapter.
[p173_e06] (heading_subsection) 5.2.1
[p173_e07] (heading_subsection) Training, validation, and test sets
[p173_e08] (body) Evaluating a model always boils down to splitting the available data into three sets: training, validation, and test. You train on the training data and evaluate your model on the validation data. Once your model is ready for prime time, you test it one final time on the test data, which is meant to be as similar as possible to production data. Then you can deploy the model in production.
[p173_e09] (body) You may ask, why not have two sets: a training set and a test set? You’d train on the training data and evaluate on the test data. Much simpler! The reason is that developing a model always involves tuning its configuration: for example, choosing the number of layers or the size of the layers (called the hyperparameters of the model, to distinguish them from the parameters, which are the network’s weights). You do this tuning by using as a feedback signal the performance of the model on the validation data. In essence, this tuning is a form of learning: a search for a good configuration in some parameter space. As a result, tuning the configuration of the model based on its performance on the validation set can quickly result in overfitting to the validation set, even though your model is never directly trained on it. Central to this phenomenon is the notion of information leaks. Every time you tune a hyperparameter of your model based on the model’s performance on the validation set, some information about the validation data leaks into the model. If you do this only once, for one parameter, then very few bits of information will leak, and your validation set will remain reliable to evaluate the model. But if you repeat this many times— running one experiment, evaluating on the validation set, and modifying your model as a result—then you’ll leak an increasingly significant amount of information about the validation set into the model. At the end of the day, you’ll end up with a model that performs artificially well on the validation data because that’s what you optimized it for. You care about performance on completely new data, not the validation data, so you need to use a completely different, never-before-seen dataset to evaluate the model: the test dataset. Your model shouldn’t have had access to any information about the test set, even indirectly. If anything about the model has been tuned based on test set performance, then your measure of generalization will be flawed. Splitting your data into training, validation, and test sets may seem straightforward, but there are a few advanced ways to do it that can come in handy when little data is available. Let’s review three classic evaluation recipes: simple hold-out validation, K-fold validation, and iterated K-fold validation with shuffling. We’ll also

past training inputs, without having to use common-sense, abstract reasoning, or external knowledge about the world—all things that machine learning models have no access to. As such, you should always keep in mind that the best way to improve a deep learning model is to train it on more data or better data (of course, adding overly noisy or inaccurate data will harm generalization). A denser coverage of the input data manifold will yield a model that generalizes better. You should never expect a deep learning model to perform anything more than crude interpolation between its training samples, and thus, you should do everything you can to make interpolation as easy as possible. The only thing you will find in a deep learning model is what you put into it: the priors encoded in its architecture and the data it was trained on.

When getting more data isn’t possible, the next-best solution is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on the smoothness of the model curve. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, or very regular patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well. The process of fighting overfitting this way is called regularization. We’ll review regularization techniques in depth in section 5.4.4. Before you can start tweaking your model to help it generalize better, you need a way to assess how your model is currently doing. In the following section, you’ll learn about how you can monitor generalization during model development: model evaluation.

Simple hold-out validation

Set apart some fraction of your data as your test set. Train on the remaining data, and evaluate on the test set. As you saw in the previous sections, to prevent information leaks, you shouldn’t tune your model based on the test set, and therefore you should also reserve a validation set.

Schematically,

looks like figure 5.12. The following listing shows a simple implementation.

Listing 5.5 Hold-out validation (note that labels are omitted for simplicity)

This is the simplest evaluation protocol, and it suffers from one flaw: if little data is available, then your validation and test sets may contain too few samples to be statistically representative of the data at hand. This is easy to recognize: if different random shuffling rounds of the data before splitting end up yielding very different measures of model performance, then you’re having this issue. K-fold validation and iterated K-fold validation are two ways to address this, as discussed next.

K-fold validation

With this approach, you split your data into `K` partitions of equal size. For each partition `i`, train a model on the remaining `K - 1` partitions and evaluate it on partition `i`.

Once you’ve achieved statistical power and you’re able to overfit, you know you’re on the right path. At this point, your goal becomes to maximize generalization performance.

This phase will take the most time: you’ll repeatedly modify your model, train it, evaluate on your validation data (not the test data, at this point), modify it again, and repeat, until the model is as good as it can get. Here are some things you should try:

Try different architectures; add or remove layers.

Add dropout.

If your model is small, add L1 or L2 regularization.

Try different hyperparameters (such as the number of units per layer or the learning rate of the optimizer) to find the optimal configuration.

Optionally, iterate on data curation or feature engineering: collect and annotate more data, develop better features, or remove features that don’t seem to be informative.

It’s possible to automate a large chunk of this work by using automated hyperparameter-tuning software, such as KerasTuner. We’ll cover this in chapter 18.

Be mindful of the following: every time you use feedback from your validation process to tune your model, you leak information about the validation process into the mode

As you learned in chapter 3, a deep learning model should never be evaluated on its training data—it’s standard practice to use a “validation set” to monitor the accuracy of the model during training. Here, you’ll create a validation set by setting apart 10,000 samples from the original training data.

You might ask, why not simply use the test data to evaluate the model? That seems like it would be easier. The reason is that you’re going to want to use the results you get on the validation set to inform your next choices to improve training—for instance, your choice of what model size to use or how many epochs to train for. When you start doing this, your validation scores stop being an accurate reflection of the performance of the model on brand-new data, since the model has been deliberately modified to perform better on the validation data. It’s good to keep around a set of never-before-seen samples that you can use to perform the final evaluation round in a completely unbiased way, and that’s exactly what the test set is. We’ll talk more about this in the next chapter.

machine learning can work on your problem. This may not always be the case!

Gradually refine your model architecture by tuning hyperparameters and adding regularization. Make changes based on performance on the validation data only, not the test data or the training data. Remember that you should get your model to overfit (thus identifying a model capacity level that’s greater than you need) and only then begin to add regularization or downsize your model. Beware of validation-set overfitting when tuning hyperparameters—the fact that your hyperparameters may end up being overspecialized to the validation set. Avoiding this is the purpose of having a separate test set!

Deploy your final model in production—as a web API, as part of a JavaScript or C++ application, on an embedded device, etc. Keep monitoring its performance on real-world data and use your findings to refine the next iteration of the model!

validation set, and a test set. The reason not to evaluate the models on the same data they were trained on quickly became evident: after just a few epochs, performance on never-before-seen data started diverging from performance on the training data, which always improves as training progresses. The models started to overfit. Overfitting happens in every machine-learning problem.

The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. Optimization refers to the process of adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data (the learning in machine learning), whereas generalization refers to how well the trained model performs on data it has never seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization, of course, but you don’t control generalization; you can only fit the model to its training data. If you do that too well, overfitting kicks in and generalization suffers. But what causes overfitting? How can we achieve good generalization?

ordered by their class, taking the first 80% of the array as your training set and the remaining 20% as your test set will result in your training set containing only classes 0–7, whereas your test set contains only classes 8–9. This seems like a ridiculous mistake, but it’s surprisingly common. For this reason, you usually should randomly shuffle your data before splitting it into training and test sets.

The arrow of time—If you’re trying to predict the future given the past (for example, tomorrow’s weather, stock movements, and so on), you should not randomly shuffle your data before splitting it because doing so will create a temporal leak: your model will effectively be trained on data from the future. In such situations, you should always make sure all data in your test set is posterior to the data in the training set.

Redundancy in your data—If some data points in your data appear twice (fairly common with real-world data), then shuffling the data and splitting it into a training set and a validation set will result in redundancy between the training and validation sets. In effect, you’ll be testing on part of your training data, which is the worst thing you can do! Make su

Having access to an extremely powerful tool for creating models that map any input space to any target space is great, but the difficult part of the machine learning workflow is often everything that comes before designing and training such models (and, for production models, what comes after, as well). Understanding the problem domain to be able to determine what to attempt to predict, given what data, and how to measure success is a prerequisite for any successful application of machine learning, and it isn’t something that advanced tools like Keras and TensorFlow can help you with. As a reminder, here’s a quick summary of the typical machine learning workflow as described in chapter 6:

Define the problem. What data is available, and what are you trying to predict? Will you need to collect more data or hire people to manually label a dataset?

Identify a way to reliably measure success on your goal. For simple tasks, this may be prediction accuracy, but in many cases, it will require sophisticated, domain-specific metrics.

Prepare the validation process that you’ll use to evaluate your models. In particular, you should define a training set, a validation set, and a test set. Th

When you take on a new machine learning project, first, define the problem at hand: – Understand the broader context of what you’re setting out to do—what’s the end goal and what are the constraints? – Collect and annotate a dataset; make sure you understand your data in depth. – Choose how you’ll measure success on your problem. What metrics will you monitor on your validation data?

Once you understand the problem and you have an appropriate dataset, develop a model: – Prepare your data. – Pick your evaluation protocol. Hold-out validation? K-fold validation? Which portion of the data should you use for validation? – Achieve statistical power: beat a simple baseline. – Scale up: develop a model that can overfit. – Regularize your model and tune its hyperparameters, based on performance on the validation data. A lot of machine learning research tends to focus only on this step—but keep the big picture in mind.

When your model is ready and yields good performance on the test data, it’s time for deployment: – First, make sure to set appropriate expectations with stakeholders. – Optimize a final model for inference, and ship the model to the deployment environment of choice—web serv

separate test set for final model evaluation, since information leaks from your validation data to your model may have occurred.

When you start working on a model, your goal is first to achieve a model that has some generalization power and that can overfit. Best practices to do this include tuning your learning rate and batch size, using better architecture priors, increasing model capacity, or simply training longer.

As your model starts overfitting, your goal switches to improving generalization through model regularization. You can reduce your model’s capacity, add dropout or weight regularization, and use early stopping. And naturally, a larger or better dataset is always the number one way to help a model generalize.
