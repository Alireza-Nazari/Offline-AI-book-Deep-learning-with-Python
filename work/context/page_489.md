[p489_e03] (bullet) The Transformer is a sequence modeling architecture that uses attention as the only mechanism to pass information across a sequence: – The Transformer works by stacking blocks of alternating attention and two-layer feedforward networks. – The Transformer can scale to many parameters and lots of training data while still improving accuracy in the language modeling problem. – Unlike RNNs, the Transformer involves no sequence-length loops at training time, making the model much easier to train in parallel across many machines. – A Transformer encoder uses bidirectional attention to build a rich representation of a sequence. – A Transformer decoder uses causal attention to predict the next word in a language model setup.

internet, there is a lot of data: facts, places, people, dates, things, and relationships. But it’s also—perhaps primarily—a database of programs.

They’re different from the kind of programs you’re used to dealing with, mind you. These are not like Python programs—series of symbolic statements processing data step by step. Instead, these vector programs are highly nonlinear functions that map the latent embedding space unto itself, analogous to Word2Vec’s magic vectors, but far more complex. In the next chapter, we will push Transformer models to an entirely new scale. Models will use billions of parameters and train on trillions of words. Output from these models can often feel like magic—like an intelligent operator sitting inside our model and pulling the strings. But it’s important to remember that these models are fundamentally interpolative—thanks to attention, they learn an interpolative embedding space for a significant chunk of all text written in the English language. Wandering this embedding space can lead to interesting, unexpected generalizations, but it cannot synthesize something fundamentally new with anything close to genuine, human-level intelligence.

Summary

A language model is a model that learns a specific probability distribution— `p(token|past tokens)`: – Language models have broad applications, but the most important is that you can generate text by calling them in a loop, where the output token at one time step becomes the input token in the next. – A masked language model learns a related probability distribution `p(tokens|surrounding` `tokens)` and can be helpful for classifying text and individual tokens. – A sequence-to-sequence language model learns to predict the next token given both past tokens in a target sequence and an entirely sep …

When I first claimed that in a not-so-distant future, most of the cultural content we consume would be created with substantial help from AIs, I was met with utter disbelief, even from long-time machine learning practitioners. That was in 2014. Fast-forward a decade, and that disbelief had receded at an incredible speed. Generative AI tools are now common additions to word processors, image editors, and development environments. Prestigious awards are going out to literature and art created with generative models—to considerable controversy and debate.1 It no

In 2017, Vaswani et al. introduced the Transformer architecture in the seminal paper “Attention Is All You Need.”1 The authors were working on translation systems like the one we just built, and the critical discovery is right in the title. As it turned out, a simple mechanism called attention can be used to construct powerful sequence models that don’t feature recurrent layers at all. The idea of attention was not new and had been used in NLP systems for a couple of years when they published. But the idea that attention was so useful it could be the only mechanism used to pass information across a sequence was quite surprising at the time.

This finding unleashed nothing short of a revolution in natural language processing—and beyond. Attention has fast become one of the most influential ideas in deep learning. In this section, you’ll get an in-depth explanation of how it works and why it has proven so effective for sequence modeling. We’ll then use attention to rebuild our English-to-Spanish translation model. So, with all that as build-up, what exactly is attention? And how does it offer a replacement for the recurrent neural networks we have used so far? Attention was actually

Subjectively, the Transformer performs significantly better than the GRU-based translation model. It’s still a toy model, but it’s a better toy model.

The Transformer is a powerful architecture that has laid the basis for an explosion of interest in text-processing models. It’s also fairly complex, as deep learning models go. After seeing all of these implementation details, one might reasonably protest that this all seems quite arbitrary. There are so many small details to take on faith. How could we possibly know this choice and configuration of layers is optimal? The answer is simple—it’s not. Over the years, a number of improvements have been proposed to the Transformer architecture by making changes to attention, normalization, and positional embeddings. Many new models in research today are replacing attention altogether with something less computationally complex as sequence lengths get very long. Eventually, perhaps by the time you are reading this book, something will have supplanted the Transformer as the dominant architecture used for language modeling. There’s a lot we can learn from the Transformer that will stand the test of time. At the end of this chapter, we will

source and target sequence as input. We will call this attention layer cross-attention as it brings information across the encoder and decoder.

to a single matrix multiplication! That’s a real problem with the expressiveness of our model.

At some point, all recurrent cells pass the input vector for each token through a dense projection and apply an activation function; we need a plan for something similar. The authors of “Attention is all you need” decided to add this back in the simplest way possible—stacking a feedforward network of two dense layers with an activation in the middle. Attention passes information across the sequence, and the feedforward network updates the representation of individual sequence items. We are ready to start building a Transformer model. Let’s start by replacing the encoder of our translation model. We will use self-attention to pass information along the source sequence of English words. We will also add in two things we learned to be particularly important when building ConvNets back in chapter 9, normalization and residual connections.

After training, we get to about 58% accuracy: on average, the model correctly predicts the next word in the Spanish sentence 58% of the time. Something is off here. Training is worse than the RNN model by 7 percentage points. Either this Transformer architecture is not what it was hyped up to be, or we missed something in our implementation. Can you spot what it is?

This section is ostensibly about sequence models. In the previous chapter, we saw how vital word order could be to meaning. And yet, the Transformer we just built wasn’t a sequence model at all. Did you notice? It’s composed of dense layers that process sequence tokens independently of each other and an attention layer that looks at the tokens as a set. You could change the order of the tokens in a sequence, and you’d get identical pairwise attention scores and the same context-aware representations. If you were to rearrange every word in every English source sentence completely, the model wouldn’t notice, and you’d still get the same accuracy. Attention is a set-processing mechanism, focused on the relationships between pairs of sequence elements—it’s blind to whether these elements occur at the beginning, at the end,

### PDF p.627 (printed 603) — 20 Conclusions › 20.1 Key concepts in review › Transformers
A Transformer looks at a set of vectors (such as word vectors) and uses neural attention to transform each vector into a representation that is aware of the context provided by the other vectors in the set. When the set in question is an ordered sequence, you can also use positional encoding to create Transformers that can take into account both global context and word order, capable of processing long text paragraphs much more effectively than RNNs or 1D ConvNets.

Transformers can be used for any set-processing or sequence-processing task, including text classification, but they excel especially at sequence-to-sequence learning, such as translating paragraphs in a source language into a target language. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer is made of two parts:

A `TransformerEncoder` that turns an input vector sequence into a context-aware, order-aware output vector sequence

A `TransformerDecoder` that takes the output of the `TransformerEncoder`, as well as a target sequence, and predicts what should come next in the target sequence

If you’re only processing a single sequence (or set) of vectors, you’d only use the `TransformerEncoder`.

Following is a sequence-to-sequence Tran

One way to use the `MultiHeadAttention` layer would be to add it to our existing RNN translation model. We could pass the sequence output from our encoder and decoder into an attention layer and use its output to update our target sequence before prediction. Attention would allow the model to handle long-range dependencies in text that the `GRU` layer will struggle with. This does, in fact, improve an RNN model’s capabilities and is how attention was first used in the mid-2010s.

However, the authors of “Attention is all you need” realized you could go further and use attention as a general mechanism for handling all sequence data in a model. Although so far we have only looked at attention as a way to handle information passing between two sequences, you could also use attention as a way to let a sequence attend to itself:
