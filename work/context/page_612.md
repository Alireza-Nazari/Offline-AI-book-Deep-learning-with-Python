[p612_e03] (body) These two poles are complementary, and it’s their interleaving that enables extreme generalization. No mind could be complete without both of them.
[p612_e04] (heading_subsection) 19.4.3 Why deep learning isn’t a complete answer to abstraction generation
[p612_e05] (body) Deep learning is very good at encoding value-centric abstraction, but it has basically no ability to generate program-centric abstraction. Human-like intelligence is a tight interleaving of both types, so we’re literally missing half of what we need—arguably the most important half.
[p612_e06] (body) Now, here’s a caveat. So far, I’ve presented each type of abstraction as entirely separate from the other—opposite, even. In practice, however, they’re more of a spectrum: to an extent, you could do reasoning by embedding discrete programs in continuous manifolds—just like you may fit a polynomial function through any set of discrete points, as long as you have enough coefficients. And inversely, you could use discrete programs to emulate continuous distance functions—after all, when you’re doing linear algebra on a computer, you’re working with continuous spaces, entirely via discrete programs that operate on 1s and 0s. However, there are clearly types of problems that are better suited to one or the other. Try to train a deep learning model to sort a list of five numbers, for instance. With the right architecture, it’s not impossible, but it’s an exercise in frustration. You’ll need a massive amount of training data to make it happen—and even then, the model will still make occasional mistakes when presented with new numbers. And if you want to start sorting lists of 10 numbers instead, you’ll need to completely retrain the model— on even more data. Meanwhile, writing a sorting algorithm in Python takes just a few lines, and the resulting program, once validated on a couple more examples, will work every time on lists of any size. That’s pretty strong generalization: going from a couple of demonstration examples and test examples to a program that can successfully process literally any list of numbers. In reverse, perception problems are a terrible fit for discrete reasoning processes. Try to write a pure-Python program to classify MNIST digits, without using any machine learning technique: you’re in for a ride. You’ll find yourself painstakingly coding functions that can detect the number of closed loops in a digit, the coordinates of the center of mass of a digit, and so on. After thousands of lines of code, you might achieve 90% test accuracy. In this case, fitting a parametric model is much simpler; it can better utilize the large amount of data that’s available, and it achieves much more robust results. If you have lots of data and you’re faced with a problem where the manifold hypothesis applies, go with deep learning. For this reason, it’s unlikely that we’ll see the rise of an approach that would reduce reasoning problems to manifold interpolation or that would reduce perception problems to discrete reasoning. The way forward in AI is to develop a unified framework that incorporates both types of abstraction generation.

19.4.2 Cognition as a combination of both kinds of abstraction

Table 19.1 compares these two poles of abstraction side by side.

Table 19.1 The two poles of abstraction

Value-centric abstraction Program-centric abstraction

Relates things by distance Relates things by exact structural match Continuous, grounded in geometry Discrete, grounded in topology Produces abstractions by “averaging” instances Produces abstractions by isolating isomorphic into “prototypes” substructures across instances Underlies perception and intuition Underlies reasoning and planning Immediate, fuzzy, approximative Slow, exact, rigorous Requires a lot of experience to produce reliable Experience efficient: can operate on as few as two results instances

Everything we do, everything we think, is a combination of these two types of abstraction. You’d be hard pressed to find tasks that only involve one of the two. Even a seemingly “pure perception” task, like recognizing objects in a scene, involves a fair amount of implicit reasoning about the relationships between the objects you’re looking at. And even a seemingly “pure reasoning” task, like finding the proof of a mathematical theorem, involves a good amount of intuition. When a mathematician puts their pen to the paper, they’ve already got a fuzzy vision of the direction in which they’re going. The discrete reasoning steps they take to get to the destination are guided by high-level intuition.

19.4.4 An alternative approach to AI: Program synthesis

Until 2024, AI systems capable of genuine discrete reasoning were all hardcoded by human programmers—for instance, software that relies on search algorithms, graph manipulation, and formal logic. In the test-time adaptation (TTA) era, this is finally starting to change. A branch of TTA that is especially promising is program synthesis—a field that is still very niche today, but that I expect to take off in a big way over the next few decades.

Program synthesis consists of automatically generating simple programs by using a search algorithm (possibly genetic search, as in genetic programming) to explore a large space of possible programs (see figure 19.14). The search stops when a program is found that matches the required specifications, often provided as a set of input-output pairs. This is highly reminiscent of machine learning: given training data provided as input-output pairs, we find a program that matches inputs to outputs and can generalize to new inputs. The difference is that instead of learning parameter values in a hardcoded program (a neural network), we generate source code via a discrete search process (see table 19.2).

Figure 19.14 A schematic view of program synthesis: given a program specification and a set of building blocks, a search process assembles the building blocks into candidate programs, which are then tested against the specification. The search continues until a valid program is found.

Deep learning can help program synthesis do the same: although each specific program we’d like to generate might be a fundamentally discrete object that performs non-interpolative data manipulation, evidence so far indicates that the space of all useful programs may look a lot like a continuous manifold. That means that a deep learning model that has been trained on millions of successful program-generation episodes might start to develop solid intuition about the path through program space that the search process should take to go from a specification to the corresponding program—just like a software engineer might have immediate intuition about the overall architecture of the script they’re about to write and about the intermediate functions and classes they should use as stepping stones on the way to the goal. Remember that human reasoning is heavily guided by value-centric abstraction— that is, by pattern recognition and intuition. The same should be true of program synthesis. I expect the general approach of guiding program search via learned heuristics to see increasing research interest over the next 10 to 20 years.

Consider the problem of adding two numbers, represented as character sequences— like “4 3 5 7 + 8 9 3 6.” Try training a Transformer on hundreds of thousands of such digit pairs: you will reach a very high accuracy. Very high, but not 100%—you will keep regularly seeing incorrect answers, because the Transformer doesn’t manage to encode the exact addition algorithm (you know, the one you learned in primary school). It is instead guessing the output by interpolating between the data points it has seen at training time. This applies to state-of-the-art LLMs, too—at least those that weren’t explicitly hardcoded to execute snippets like “4357 + 8936” in Python to provide the right answer. They’ve seen enough examples of digit addition that they can add numbers, but they only have about 70% accuracy—quite underwhelming. Further, their accuracy is strongly dependent on which digits are being added, with more common digits leading to higher accuracy. The reason why a deep learning model does not end up learning an exact addition algorithm even after seeing millions of examples is that it is just a static chain of simple, continuous geometric transformations mapping one vector space into a

The problem with deep learning models isn’t just that they’re limited to blindly reapplying patterns they’ve memorized at training time or that they’re highly sensitive to how their input is presented. Even if you just need to query and apply a well-known program, and you know exactly how to address this program in latent space, you still face a major issue: the programs memorized by deep learning models often don’t generalize well. They will work for some input values and fail for some other input values. This is especially true for programs that encode any kind of discrete logic.

broader than what can be represented with current deep learning models, and some of these programs could achieve superior generalization power. Importantly, such programs will not be differentiable end to end, although specific modules will remain differentiable, and thus will need to be generated via a combination of discrete program search and gradient descent.

We’ll move away from having, on one hand, hardcoded algorithmic intelligence (handcrafted software) and, on the other hand, learned geometric intelligence (deep learning). Instead, we’ll have a blend of formal algorithmic modules that provide reasoning and abstraction capabilities and geometric modules that provide informal intuition and pattern-recognition capabilities (figure 19.15). The entire system will be learned with little or no human involvement. This should dramatically expand the scope of problems that can be solved with machine learning—the space of programs that we can generate automatically, given appropriate training data. Systems like AlphaGo—or even RNNs—can be seen as a prehistoric ancestor of such hybrid algorithmic-geometric models.

Solving human-like fluid intelligence (and ARC-AGI-2) requires moving beyond the limitations inherent in current approaches. While deep learning excels at value-centric abstraction, which enables pattern recognition and intuition, it fundamentally lacks capabilities for program-centric abstraction, which underpins discrete reasoning, planning, and causal understanding. Human intelligence seamlessly integrates both— future AI must do the same.

Future key developments may include

Hybrid models—Future models will likely integrate learned algorithmic modules (providing reasoning and symbolic manipulation) with deep learning modules (providing perception and intuition). These systems might learn to use programming primitives like control flow, variables, recursion, and complex data structures dynamically.

Deep-learning guided program search—Program synthesis—automatically discovering executable code that meets specifications—offers a route to program-centric abstraction. However, its reliance on inefficient discrete search is a major bottleneck. A crucial advance will be using deep learning to guide this search, utilizing learned intuition about program structure to navigate vast, co

You’ve already learned that generalization in deep learning originates from the latent structure of your data. If your data makes it possible to smoothly interpolate between samples, then you will be able to train a deep learning model that generalizes. If your problem is overly noisy or fundamentally discrete, like, say, list sorting, deep learning will not help you. Deep learning is curve fitting, not magic.

As such, it is essential that you make sure that you’re working with an appropriate dataset. Spending more effort and money on data collection almost always yields a much greater return on investment than spending the same on developing a better model:

Make sure you have enough data. Remember that you need a dense sampling of the input-cross-output space. More data will yield a better model. Sometimes, problems that seem impossible at first become solvable with a larger dataset.

Minimize labeling errors—visualize your inputs to check for anomalies, and proofread your labels.

Clean your data and deal with missing values (we cover this in the next chapter).

If you have many features and you aren’t sure which ones are actually useful, do feature selection.

Of course, deep learning isn’t going anywhere. Program synthesis isn’t its replacement; it is its complement. It’s the hemisphere that has been so far missing from our artificial brains. We’re going to be using both, in combination. There are two major ways this will take place:

Developing systems that integrate both deep learning modules and discrete algorithmic modules

Using deep learning to make the program search process itself more efficient

Let’s review each of these possible avenues.

In fact, you don’t even need to do this with MNIST data—you could just generate white noise inputs and random labels. You could fit a model on that, too, as long as it has enough parameters. It would just end up memorizing specific inputs, much like a Python dictionary.

If this is the case, then why do deep learning models generalize at all? Shouldn’t they just learn an ad hoc mapping between training inputs and targets, like a fancy `dict`? What expectation can we have that this mapping will work for new inputs? As it turns out, the nature of generalization in deep learning has rather little to do with deep learning models themselves and much to do with the structure of information in the real world. Let’s take a look at what’s really going on here.
