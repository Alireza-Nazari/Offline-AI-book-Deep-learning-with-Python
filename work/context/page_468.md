[p468_e05] (body) One way to use the `MultiHeadAttention` layer would be to add it to our existing RNN translation model. We could pass the sequence output from our encoder and decoder into an attention layer and use its output to update our target sequence before prediction. Attention would allow the model to handle long-range dependencies in text that the `GRU` layer will struggle with. This does, in fact, improve an RNN model’s capabilities and is how attention was first used in the mid-2010s.
[p468_e06] (body) However, the authors of “Attention is all you need” realized you could go further and use attention as a general mechanism for handling all sequence data in a model. Although so far we have only looked at attention as a way to handle information passing between two sequences, you could also use attention as a way to let a sequence attend to itself:
[p468_e07] (code)
```
multi_head_attention(key=source, value=source, query=source)
```
[p468_e08] (body) This is called self-attention, and it is quite powerful. With self-attention, each token can attend to every token in its own sequence, including itself, allowing the model to learn a representation of the word in context.
[p468_e09] (body) Consider an example sentence: “The train left the station on time.” Now, consider one word in the sentence: “station.” What kind of station are we talking about? Could it be a radio station? Maybe the International Space Station? With self-attention, the model could learn to give a high attention score to the pair of “station” and “train,” summing the vector used to represent “train” into the representation of the word “station.” Self-attention gives the model an effective way to go from representing a word in a vacuum to representing a word conditioned on all other tokens that appear in the sequence. This sounds a lot like what an RNN is supposed to do. Can we just go ahead and replace our RNN layers with `MultiHeadAttention`? Almost! But not quite; we still need an essential ingredient for any deep neural network—a nonlinear activation function. The `MultiHeadAttention` layer combines linear projections of every element in a source sequence, but that’s it. In a sense, it’s a very expressive pooling operation. Consider, in the extreme case, a token length of one. In this case, the attention score matrix is always a single one, and the entire layer boils down to a linear projection of the source sequence, with no nonlinearities. You could stack 100 attention layers together and still be able to simplify the entire computation

tokens at once, the interesting features of individual source tokens will get “washed out” in the combined representation. A simple trick that works well is to do this attention operation several times for the same sequence, with several different attention heads running the same computation with different parameters:

By projecting the query and key differently, one head might learn to match the subject of the source sentence, while another head might attend to punctuation. This multi-headed attention avoids the limitation of needing to combine the entire source sequence with a single softmax sum (figure 15.7).

Figure 15.7 Multi-headed attention allows each target word to attend to different parts of the source sequence in separate partitions of the eventual output vector.

Of course, in practice, you would want to write this code as a reusable layer. Here, Keras has you covered. We can recreate our previous code with the `MultiHeadAttention` layer as follows:

to a single matrix multiplication! That’s a real problem with the expressiveness of our model.

At some point, all recurrent cells pass the input vector for each token through a dense projection and apply an activation function; we need a plan for something similar. The authors of “Attention is all you need” decided to add this back in the simplest way possible—stacking a feedforward network of two dense layers with an activation in the middle. Attention passes information across the sequence, and the feedforward network updates the representation of individual sequence items. We are ready to start building a Transformer model. Let’s start by replacing the encoder of our translation model. We will use self-attention to pass information along the source sequence of English words. We will also add in two things we learned to be particularly important when building ConvNets back in chapter 9, normalization and residual connections.

Listing 15.14 A Transformer encoder block

You’ll note that the normalization layers we’re using here aren’t `BatchNormalization` layers like those we’ve used in image models. That’s because `BatchNormalization` doesn’t work well for sequence data. Instead, we’re using the `LayerNormalization` layer, which normalizes each sequence independently from other sequences in the batch— like this, in NumPy-like pseudocode:

Let’s revisit our translation RNN and try to add the notion of selective attention. Consider predicting just a single token. After passing the `source` and `target` sequences through our `GRU` layers, we will have a vector representing the target token we are about to predict and a sequence of vectors representing each word in the source text.

With attention, our goal is to give the model a way to score every single vector in our source sequence based on its relevance to the current word we are trying to predict (figure 15.4). If the vector representation of a source token has a high score, we consider it particularly important; if not, we care less about it. For now, let’s assume we have this function `score(target_vector, source_vector)`.

### PDF p.471 (printed 447) — 15 Language models and the Transformer › 15.3 The Transformer architecture › 
Our decoder layer takes in both a `target` and `source`. Like with the `Transformer` `Encoder`, we take in a `source_mask` that marks the location of all padding in the source input (`True` for non-padding, `False` for padding) and use it as an `attention_mask` for the cross-attention layer.

For the decoder’s self-attention layer, we need a different type of attention mask. Recall that when we built our RNN decoder, we avoided using a `Bidirectional` RNN. If we had used one, the model would be able to cheat by seeing the label it was trying to predict as a feature! Attention is inherently bidirectional; in self-attention, any token position in the target sequence can attend to any other position. Without special care,

Next up is the decoder block. This layer will be almost identical to the encoder block, except we want the decoder to use the encoder output sequence as an input. To do this, we can use attention twice. We first apply a self-attention layer like our encoder, which allows each position in the target sequence to use information from other target positions. We then add another `MultiHeadAttention` layer, which receives both the

### PDF p.461 (printed 437) — 15 Language models and the Transformer › 15.3 The Transformer architecture › 15.3 The Transformer architecture
In 2017, Vaswani et al. introduced the Transformer architecture in the seminal paper “Attention Is All You Need.”1 The authors were working on translation systems like the one we just built, and the critical discovery is right in the title. As it turned out, a simple mechanism called attention can be used to construct powerful sequence models that don’t feature recurrent layers at all. The idea of attention was not new and had been used in NLP systems for a couple of years when they published. But the idea that attention was so useful it could be the only mechanism used to pass information across a sequence was quite surprising at the time.

This finding unleashed nothing short of a revolution in natural language processing—and beyond. Attention has fast become one of the most influential ideas in deep learning. In this section, you’ll get an in-depth explanation of how it works and why it has proven so effective for sequence modeling. We’ll then use attention to rebuild our English-to-Spanish translation model. So, with all that as build-up, what exactly is attention? And how does it offer a replacement for the recurrent neural networks we have used so far? Attention was actually

Each row `i` can be read as a mask for attention for the target token at position `i`. In the first row, the first token can only attend to itself. In the second row, the second token can attend to both the first and second tokens, and so forth. This gives us the same effect as our RNN layer, where information can only propagate forward in the sequence, not backward. In Keras, you can specify this lower-triangular mask simply by passing `use_casual_mask` to the `MultiHeadAttention` layer when calling it. Figure 15.8 shows a visual representation of the layers in both the encoder and decoder layers, when stacked into a Transformer model.

France?”, the learned representation of the word “Where” cannot attend to the words “capital” and “France” in the attention layer. This limits the expressivity of the model but has a massive advantage in terms of simplicity of pretraining. We don’t need to curate datasets with pairs of inputs and outputs; everything can be a single sequence. We can train on any text we can find on the internet at a massive scale.

Let’s copy the `TransformerDecoder` from chapter 15 but remove the cross-attention layer, which allowed the decoder to attend to the encoder sequence. We will also make one minor change, adding dropout after the attention and feedforward blocks. In chapter 15, we only used a single Transformer layer in our encoder and decoder, so we could get away with only using a single dropout layer at the end of our entire model. For our GPT model, we will stack quite a few layers, so adding dropout within each decoder layer is important to prevent overfitting.

The Transformer is a sequence modeling architecture that uses attention as the only mechanism to pass information across a sequence: – The Transformer works by stacking blocks of alternating attention and two-layer feedforward networks. – The Transformer can scale to many parameters and lots of training data while still improving accuracy in the language modeling problem. – Unlike RNNs, the Transformer involves no sequence-length loops at training time, making the model much easier to train in parallel across many machines. – A Transformer encoder uses bidirectional attention to build a rich representation of a sequence. – A Transformer decoder uses causal attention to predict the next word in a language model setup.
